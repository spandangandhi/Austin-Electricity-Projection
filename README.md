Accurate forecasts for electricity demand are important for electric utilities and regional transmission organizations. Long term forecasts can reduce investment risk, medium term forecasts help in planning fuel purchases and scheduling plant maintenance, and short term forecasts are essential in matching electricity generation and demand for grid reliability.

This project focuses on medium term forecasting, specifically making one-week-out forecasts at a resolution of one hour for Austin, Texas. Historical electricity demand and weather data from 2002-2017 is used. A combination of timeseries analysis and regression models are used to make forecasting predictions, which are compared against the observed hourly electricity demand for a series of one-week intervals.
